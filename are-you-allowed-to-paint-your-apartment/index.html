<h3 id="you-can-talk-to-your-landlord-about-these-options-because-this-is-typically-a-change-you-can-make-that">You can talk to your landlord about these options because this is typically a change you can make that.</h3><p>Whether you select a pristine white, a palette of trusty neutral paint colors, or a soothing blue, the color of your walls can significantly influence the overall feel of a room. There�s still hope for how you envisioned your apartment looking. Perhaps the most disappointing consequence of living in a rental is not being able to paint your space with the interior paint colors of your dreams. If you are a leaseholder, you may first need to get permission from your landlord, freeholder or management company. Have a look through your tenancy agreement—some contracts say painting is not allowed. You will not need to apply for planning permission to paint or maintain the external walls of your flat or maisonette.</p>
