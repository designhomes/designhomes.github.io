<p>I spoke to bird fan and ecologist tom hunt from adelaide for his top tips for bringing all the birds to. Keeping the bird feeder full is a great way to keep the birds coming back when they do start coming. Try mixing a few different plants in one large container for a bright, colorful arrangement.
