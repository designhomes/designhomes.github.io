<p>In fact, it is recommended that after your surgery, you should wait at least 18 months before trying to conceive again. Was scheduled to have a second c section but baby came early naturally and labour was so quick i didn’t have time to have a c section so did a vbac. Wait 18 months and that risk dropped to.</p>

<p>There are four published studies that go over these risks, each showing different interval recommendations. Your risk of rupture can depend on the way the c section was done so it is best to ask and expereinced doctor if there is any concern I one big cut and a small one, 10 months later september 2006.
