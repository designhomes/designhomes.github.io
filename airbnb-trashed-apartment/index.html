<p>There’s stories on airbnb forums of hosts who lost property and worse, airbnb didn’t pay. We had one guest who trashed our place. Airbnb said it had banned those who booked the house, and incidents like this. For brisbane property owner jenny rylance, the bill is about $50,000. Airbnb is useless for their hosts when it really matters.</p>

<p>Ms rylance told a current affair airbnb guests decimated every room in her luxury property, with glass broken, painting and tvs stolen. Garbage over flowing and not disposed.

<p>So now i am going after airbnb�s host guarantee. The host returns to her home to find it trashed and covered with faeces, urine and rubbish. Melbourne airbnb �trashed by gang�, werribee street left in a mess. Owner of the apartment says it needs £10,000 worth of repairs. This set of guests, however, trashed the apartment.</p>

<p>I still don’t believe they would have. Airbnb guests trashed this guy�s $2.5 million condo setting off a saga that cost him $25,000. Which is all super great. The hot tub overflowed a bit and affected the electrical panel. While the investigation into that case continues, it seems the whole apartment ransacking facilitated by airbnb thing isn’t a one off.</p>
