<p>I�m totally on board for splitting friends into two separate shows, but i just can�t seem to get it to work. To have plex see them as two different files, go back to the “•••” menu and choose “split apart”: I have two tv series with similar names (“the powerpuff girls” and “the powerpuff girls (2016)”). I�ve confirmed that plex sees both versions, as i have the 2 in the corner of every episode.</p>
<h3 id="i-have-always-used-the-instructions-located-here">I have always used the instructions located here:</h3><p>A couple of titles that i checked are ones where the movie is split into two files. Example is the 1939 buck rogers serial. 4 million bosnian marks in payments for renouncing citizenship in 2019. I have always used the instructions located here: Following plex�s guidelines , it should be something like this: I�ve even found 2 other posts about this but they�ve never been answered.</p>
