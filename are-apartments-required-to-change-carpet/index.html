<p>This is something you have to consider even if you have modern carpets at home. The primary purpose of this practice is to reduce the level of noise and decrease the risk of disturbing the downstairs neighbors.

<p>Most of the time, they don’t do this because it would require covering all your furniture and the carpet. For a mat with no pad, use a wet vac to remove the water.
