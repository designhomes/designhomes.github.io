<p>Each applicant over the age of 18 must submit an individual application with proper references. My credit isn�t amazing and i was surprised the only conditions directly for me were an lox (did i acquire new debt) for inquires and addresses.

<p>If you have questions, contact the apartment leasing office and ask them what conditions need to be rectified.
