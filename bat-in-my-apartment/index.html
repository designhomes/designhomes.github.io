Bats are very intelligent and can easily squeeze through a 1/4 x 1/2 inch crack. These creatures feed on insects during their night flights, so if they find a place that has plenty of food and a nice shelter, they will claim this roosting area as their home. A bat found its way into my apartment in burlington vermont in the summer of 2006 while i was having people over. But redemption is sometimes possible once a bat enters your home. If the bat doesn�t exit on their own, it is best to wait until they land to try to catch them.</p>
