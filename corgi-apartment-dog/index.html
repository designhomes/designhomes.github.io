<p>Corgis should never be made to live in an apartment without careful preparation. Since they’re high energy, you’ll need to take them out for several walks throughout the day, but this is ideal for any dog’s health.

<p>Corgis are watchful dogs, so they do well in an apartment with windows where they can watch the street outside.
