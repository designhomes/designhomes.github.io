My unexpected living room arrangement House Mix From housemixblog.com</p>
<p>Spacing in your living room can make or break any layout. Not keeping enough space between furniture to easily walk and move throughout the room will make it not only look odd and cramped, but it makes the room impractical and uncomfortable—exactly what you don�t want to happen in your living room. But this attempt to claim back those precious few inches can often have an adverse effect. Keeping the layout fluid is key to making their home multifunctional.</p>
<h3 id="this-is-how-your-friends-will-remember-your-house">This is how your friends will remember your house.</h3><p>In this example, the layout and lighting has made the difference and converted this rather small room into a well defined living room space. Two small sofas facing each other, a coffee table between them. This is how your friends will remember your house. The above layout foregoes a loveseat and in its place uses armchairs. For many apartment dwellers, the kitchen and living room are practically one and the same. Whether facing into the room or out, floating furniture can give the illusion of a more spacious living room.</p>
